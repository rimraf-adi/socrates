we need two agents
1. generator
2. critic

a task will be assigned to generator, it will generate a response
then critic will review the response and provide feedback
then generator will improve the response based on the feedback

do this for given number of iterations

the project will follow a directory structure with spec.md

and in rootdir we will run the task using a command and the output will be stored in a given dir
LMstudio LLMs for this with searxng access to the generator

both of them will have agentic behaviour, langgraph or pydantic whatever is suitable
